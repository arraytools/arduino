/* Using the MMA7361 Accelerometer as an impact sensor
  This is a simple sketch dependent on the work of Russell Cameron (OddBott) of
  Dagu Robots that demonstrates the use of an accelerometer as an impact or "bump" sensor.
  Note that on the Dagu MicroMagician board that the accelerometer is hardwired in.
  This example is for Arduino boards and an outboard MMA7361.  For purposes of
  this demonstration, there is an LED wired to digital pin 13, the sleep pin on the MMA7361
  is on digital 12 and kept HIGH so that the unit doesn't go to sleep, and the X, Y and Z pins
  are attached to analog 0, 1 and 2 respectively.  Almoost all of this code is just lifted wholesale
  from the Micromagician library and examples provided with it.  All I did was define pins and
  adjust it a little for the purpose at hand.
